==

This project uses generative models and deep auto-encoders to infer the underlying musical structure of audio clips.

## Dependencies
* This project depends on a fork of `python-musical`, the original of which can be installed from https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-musical/. The fork that this project uses is located at https://github.com/turbomaze/python-musical.

* To compute the FFT of the input audio files, this project uses `matplotlib.mlab`.

* This project uses `numpy` for miscellaneous math.

* This project uses `scipy` for some `.wav` file utilities.

* This project requires `h5py` to save Keras models.
